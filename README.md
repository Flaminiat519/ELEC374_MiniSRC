# MiniSRC CPU — ELEC 374 Final Project

A fully functional 32-bit RISC-style CPU designed and implemented in Verilog, the CPU is synthesized and deployed on the **Altera DE0-CV FPGA** development board.

---

## Overview

The MiniSRC is a 32-bit CPU based on a single-bus architecture. It supports a custom instruction set including arithmetic, logical, shift, memory, and branch operations. The design follows a multi-cycle execution model, with a dedicated control unit driving all datapath components through a finite state machine (FSM).

## Architecture

### Single-Bus Datapath
All internal data transfer happens over a shared 32-bit bus. Each register drives the bus through an output enable signal and latches data from the bus through an input enable signal, both controlled by the control unit.

### Key Components

| Module | Description |
|---|---|
| `CPU` | Top-level module — connects the control unit and datapath |
| `control_unit` | FSM-based instruction decoder — drives all control signals |
| `data_path` | Contains all registers, ALU, bus, and memory connections |
| `ALU` | 32-bit ALU supporting 13 operations |
| `Bus` | 32-bit bus multiplexer — selects which register drives the bus |
| `ram` | 512 × 32-bit synchronous RAM, initialized from a `.hex` file |
| `CLA_32` | 32-bit carry-lookahead adder (built from two 16-bit CLAs) |
| `CLA_16` | 16-bit carry-lookahead adder (built from four 4-bit CLAs) |
| `CLA_4` | 4-bit carry-lookahead adder using generate/propagate logic |
| `mult_32b` | 32-bit Booth's algorithm multiplier — 64-bit result |
| `div` | 32-bit non-restoring division — produces quotient and remainder |
| `con_ff` | Conditional flip-flop — evaluates branch conditions |
| `select_and_encode_logic` | Decodes IR register fields into register file enable signals |
| `pc_reg` | Program counter — supports load, increment, and reset |
| `mdr_reg` | MDR — selects between bus data and memory data |
| `register` | General-purpose 32-bit register |
| `register0` | R0 — forces output to 0 when BAout is asserted |

### Registers

| Register | Purpose |
|---|---|
| R0–R15 | General-purpose 32-bit registers (R0 hardwired to 0 for base addressing) |
| HI / LO | Hold the upper and lower 32 bits of MUL/DIV results |
| PC | Program counter |
| IR | Instruction register |
| MAR | Memory address register |
| MDR | Memory data register |
| Y | ALU input buffer |
| Z / ZHI | ALU result registers (low and high word) |
